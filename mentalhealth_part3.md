 ## Overview

As mention in my previous parts, my audience for this project is the general public as the mental health importance is applicable for all. I want people to understand that mental illness is not a taboo. It is quite common for someone to be mentally ill at any point in time. Instead of silently struggling it is better to seek help and get out of it. 

In my Part I,  I  primarily focused on the impacts of the COVID-19 on the mental health of Americans.  I used Balsamic and hand sketches for putting the idea. I was suggested not to concentrate on COVID but Mental health on a broader sense.

Part II is when I took off, putting my ideas together. I wanted to keep everything digital.  I also looked at the datasets where I can get relevant information regarding my project. User feedback was extremely helpful as I got a different perspective on how viewers interpret the visualizations. I was able to quickly course correct where I went wrong.

Once I gave the problem context, I wanted the reader to know that there are ways to combat mental illness and improve mental health. I want to let the reader know that there are natural ways to improve mental health. There are a lot of options available to improve mental health. In this story, I have dealt with some of them.

At the end of the story, I have specified call to action in a nutshell so that it can be a key takeaway for the reader. I would like the reader to go with confidence and take care of mental health seriously.

My entire project and wireframes were done with Shorthand and Tableau. I became a big fan of shorthand based on the excellent templates that were available.   I concentrated primarily on Tableau charts and Shorthand to make it more appealing so that I can get feedback from reviewers in a more detailed way.  One of my favorite thing in the project was learning Tableau. I cannot say I am well versed but I developed a liking for showing poweful visualization.

* Gathered relevant pictures from unsplash and different web sources.   
* Used Shorthand so that it could give much appeal for the storyboarding.  
* Created Tableau from the data sources that were provided in the Part1.  
* All the tableau visualizations are posted to Tableau Public.Its Embed code is linked to shorthand using the Custom HTML block.
