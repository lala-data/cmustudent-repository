 ## Project Overview

Based on the feedback received from the last class I deviated from the original storyboard which I proposed in part1.  
My original Proposal was to study the mental health during the COVID. I modified to concentrate on Mental health as a whole.  
I already decided to make my final project in Shorthand. Therefore I did not change the original balsamiq mockup or sketched again. Instead I concentrated primarily on Tableau charts and Shorthand to make it more appealing so that I can get feedback from reviewers in a more detailed way.  
* Gathered relevant pictures from unsplash and different web sources.   
* Used Shorthand so that it could give much appeal for the storyboarding.  
* Created Tableau from the data sources that were provided in the Part1.  
* All the tableau visualizations are posted to Tableau Public.Its Embed code is linked to shorthand using the Custom HTML block.
