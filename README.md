This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
I am Lala Viswanath,I am a Software Architect based out of Detroit MI.
Currently pursuing MSIT BIDA course at CMU. I am fully remote.I am currently two-third of my course.
Planning to graduate next summer.In my day work, I sometimes play around with data and to do lot of analysis to figure out issues.
I also work around data to provide volume trends and growth of our programs so that I can get Executive buy-in.

# What I hope to learn
Data Visualization techniques will be useful for my Analysis and presentation to my stakeholders.
Usually I use Excel for my visualizations. My graphs and Charts are more tech focused rather than Visually correct.
This course would definitely help me to put across my perspective in appealing manner.I find this course very interesting.

# Portfolio
This site will contain all my Data Visualizations done in this class
