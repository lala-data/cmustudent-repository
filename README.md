This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
I am Lala Viswanath.I am a Software Architect based out of Detroit MI.
Currently pursuing MSIT BIDA program at CMU. I am taking this fully remote and my company sponsors my entire program.
I am currently two-third of my program.Planning to graduate next summer.BIDA program is around data and analytics which is the future.
In my day work, I sometimes play around with data  to do lot of analysis and figure out issues.
I use data to provide volume trends and growth of our programs so that I can get Executive buy-in for new features.

# What I hope to learn
Data Visualization techniques will be useful for my Analysis and presentation to my stakeholders.
Usually I use Excel for my visualizations. My graphs and Charts are more tech focused rather than Visually correct.
This course would definitely help me to put across my perspective in appealing manner.
I would like to explain the problem in terms of storytelling with Visualizations so that audience can quickly grasp the content.
I found this course very interesting.

# Portfolio
This site will contain all my Data Visualizations done in this class
