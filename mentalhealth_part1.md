## Introduction

Recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world in a big way. Normal life in the world has changed a lot since then. Social Distancing is becoming a popular term than Social networking. Governments across the world are taking active steps in mitigating this pandemic and encouraging citizens to be safe in whatever way they can. Majority of the companies where remote working can be accomplished are fully embracing the technology. Schools across the world are slowly adopting remote curriculum and learning. The entire population is adopting new means to interact with the world. While a lot has been talked about COVID impacts and safety on a macro level, I would like this project to be more focused on the micro-level namely - an Individual. This article will predominantly focus on mental health (to overcome anxiety and depression) during these tough times and come out of this situation successfully. This can apply to any tough situation humanity faces and not necessarily COVID. However, COVID is taken as an example to highlight the mental health. While some of the data used for visualization are sourced from different 

## Audience

This project is targeted for all individuals who would like to keep up their mental health who is currently missing social interactions and outdoor activities. Majority of the information in this project is based on my personal views and information available in websites (which will be cited). I am by no means an expert on this topic, but I strongly believe that with a strong mental health and support system we can go through any crisis times successfully.

## Story Arc and Call for action
Below is the story I framed.  
"As an Individual,Inspite of uncertainties around the world like COVID 19, I would like to remain positive by maintaining physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing so that I can overcome this situation gracefully. I can overcome this by keeping me informed through right sources, having an active lifestyle, following the prescribed guidelines from Government and seeking counselling if required."
