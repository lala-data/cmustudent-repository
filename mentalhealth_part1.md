## Introduction

Recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world in a big way. Normal life in the world has changed a lot since then. Social Distancing is becoming a popular term than Social networking. Governments across the world are taking active steps in mitigating this pandemic and encouraging citizens to be safe in whatever way they can. Majority of the companies where remote working can be accomplished are fully embracing the technology. Schools across the world are slowly adopting remote curriculum and learning. The entire population is adopting new means to interact with the world. While a lot has been talked about COVID impacts and safety on a macro level, I would like this project to be more focused on the micro-level namely - an Individual. This article will predominantly focus on mental health (to overcome anxiety and depression) during these tough times and come out of this situation successfully. This can apply to any tough situation humanity faces and not necessarily COVID. However, COVID is taken as an example to highlight the mental health. While some of the data used for visualization are sourced from different 

## Audience

This project is targeted for all individuals who would like to keep up their mental health who is currently missing social interactions and outdoor activities. Majority of the information are based on personal ideas. I am by no means an expert on this topic, but I strongly believe that with a strong mental health and support system we can go through any crisis times successfully.

## Story Arc and Call for action
Below is the story I framed.
"As an Individual,Inspite of uncertainties around the world because of COVID 19, I would like to remain positive by maintaining physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing so that I can overcome this situation gracefully. I can overcome this by keeping me informed through right sources, having an active lifestyle, following the prescribed guidelines from Government and seeking counselling if required."

## Topics addressed

I would like to basicaly apprise the audience with the avenues that would be used to keep the mental health in the better shape:
  * How physical health and activity will take of mental health?
  * How can we improve it?
  * what are the ways to improve it?
  * what are the ways to keep informed?
  * what are the ways to keep socially connected?
  * How to cope up with anxiety and depression because of lost job,health etc?

## Wireframe Mockup

I did a wireframe mockup to better represent the story arc provided.Even though chart talks specifically to a COVID situation it is generally applicable to any crisis in the world.

## Visualization strategy

I am planning to use Tableau as the main tool to create Visualizations. The visualiations I am planning is mostly from CDC and other wesites related to mental health.I am thinking about close to 5-6 visualizations. I will be using Shorthand for my final project presentation.

## Data

https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/
Industry Data: I will be using dates from company entries into Pittsburgh and create a timeline of their arrival. Data was scraped from this report and put into an Excel file.

University Data: I will be using information scraped from QS University Subject Rankings on top-rated programs in Pittsburgh at different universities and I will be formulating a table.

Sports Data: I have compiled a list of national championships, from Google's database and manipulated turned it into an Excel file.  I will be displaying them by the organization and I plan on using their logos as a way to visualize each team.

Art Data: I found some interesting statistics from Pittsburgh Art Council and will be highlighting it in text.

Restaurant Data: I will be using geolocation data from OpenData to create a map, and then I will be scraping Yelp for data on 5 different restaurants in Pittsburgh I want to highlight. I haven’t decided which restaurants I want to highlight, but I think it will be one from each popular neighborhood: Mt. Washington, Lawrenceville, Downtown, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill.

Affordability Data: I found this dataset on Numbeo and transformed it to an Excel. I plan on using a bar chart to highlight Pittsburgh’s ranking, and then point out other high-tech cities such as San Fran, Denver, Austin, NYC.
