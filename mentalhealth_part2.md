## Wireframes/Storyboards

Based on the feedback receive from the last class I deviated from the original storyboard which I proposed in part1.
My origial Proposal was to study the mental health during the COVID. I modified to study Mental health as a whole.
I did not change the balsamiq mockup or sketched again. Instead I concentrated primarily on Tableau charts and Shorthand to make it more appealing so that I can get feedback from reviewers in a more precise way.
I gathered relevant pictures from unsplash and different web sources. 
I used Shorthand so that it could give much appeal for the story.
I created Tableau from the data sources that were provided in the Part1.

## User Research and Interviews Feedback:


| Question      | Reviewer1 | Reviewer1 | Reviewer3  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Is it clear and easy to understand?      | Yes, you are telling your audience that people from all walks of life can be affected by a mental illness. Your call to action in concise and direct.       | Header      | Title       |
| Did you feel engaged?   | I felt somewhat engaged. Honestly, there was a lot of text to get through and I found myself skimming over sections. Maybe trim some things down? Or rearrange into graphics or quick facts?        | Header      | Title       |
| What is unclear or confusing?   | A few things:
-	Is there a definition for the Household Pulse Survey? I like your data viz, but I wasn’t quite sure what it meant in regards to its data source.
-	Also, I was confused about the Percentage of People without lasting Mental Illness (Primarily Depression and Anxiety). What does that mean? And if it isn’t lasting, are you looking at people no longer with mental illness? 
       | Header      | Title       |
| Do the use of Data and Visualizations help you to understand the context and support the presentation?     | Yes. Can you enlarge them in Shorthand though? They are a bit small. Also, be aware that it looks like you changed up some colors (in the age groups, the colors aren’t consistent with the groupings throughout all the graphs). I would also recommend not putting the source directly above the graph, as it makes it look like the title.       | Header      | Title       |
| Did something surprise you?  | It was surprising that the youth numbers are so much higher than the other groups.        | Header      | Title       |
| Is there a clear “call to action” or next step? what do you think it is?   | Yes, the call to action is clear. You don’t present data on 4 out of the 5 things listed, which may not be a bad thing, just something I noticed.        | Header      | Title       |
| what did you like the most?   | I really liked your introduction. I thought it was compelling and encouraged me to scroll down quickly.        | Header      | Title       |
| Suggestions on improvement?  | Overall, I was impressed! I think your information looks good in Shorthand. I liked how you revised so COVID wasn’t overpowering the subject. Also, I understand the importance of the text, but I think there are some sections that could be trimmed down. It looks like you have made amazing headway for the final project!!        | Header      | Title       |

## Audience

This project is targeted for all individuals who would like to keep up their mental health who is currently missing social interactions and outdoor activities. Majority of the information in this project is based on my personal views and information available in websites (which will be cited). I am by no means an expert on this topic, but I strongly believe that with a strong mental health and support system we can go through any crisis times successfully.

## Story Arc and Call for action
Below is the story I framed.  
"As an Individual,Inspite of uncertainties around the world like COVID 19, I would like to remain positive by maintaining physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing so that I can overcome this situation gracefully. I can overcome this by keeping me informed through right sources, having an active lifestyle, following the prescribed guidelines from Government and seeking counselling if required."

## Topics addressed

I would like to basicaly apprise the audience with the avenues that would be used to keep the mental health in the better shape:
  * How physical health and activity will take of mental health?
  * How can we improve it?
  * what are the ways to improve it?
  * what are the ways to keep informed?
  * what are the ways to keep socially connected?
  * How to cope up with anxiety and depression because of lost job,health etc?

## Wireframe Mockup

I did a wireframe mockup to better represent the story arc provided.Even though chart talks specifically to a COVID situation it is generally applicable to any crisis in the world.

## Method and Medium

I am planning to use Tableau as the main tool to create Visualizations. The visualizations I am planning is mostly from CDC and other websites related to mental health.I am thinking about close to 4-5 visualizations.  
I will be using Shorthand for my final project presentation.For images in my presentation I would source it from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
